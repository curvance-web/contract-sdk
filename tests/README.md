## Notes:
- Be sure to set `TEST_RPC`, All tests are currently being done using a local anvil fork of Monad
- `TEST_CHAIN` will also need to be set so we know what setup to use which will grab that chains deployment addresses
- Tests are currently built around Monad deployment, but can potentially work with any `TEST_RPC`
